# Movies-ETL
Extracting, transforming, and loading large scale and complex series of data from IMDb, MovieLens (via Kaggle), and Wikipedia.

## Overview
The Amazing Prime Video team would like to develop an algorithm to predict which low-budget movies that are being released will become popular so that they can buy the streaming rates at a bargain price. Amazing Prime has decided to sponsor a hackathon and has provided a set of movie data. The goal of the hackathon is to see if participants will be able to predict the popular movies. The data we are given is IMDb movie data, MovieLens review data taken from Kaggle, and a JSON web scrape of Wikipedia movies. In preparation for the hackathon we performed the following steps:

1. Write an ETL function to read three data files
2. Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
3. Extract and Transform the Kaggle Data
4. Create the Movie Database
